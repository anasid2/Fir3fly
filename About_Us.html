<div>Hey my name is Favour Agabi. I am 15 years old and I am currently engaged in the Girl Code Program, located at First Data. I love running, helping others, going above and beyond and hanging out with friends. Iâ€™m very excited about this website due to the fact that it is all about helping others in need and just putting a smile on peoples faces, which is something you would do as a christian.</div>
